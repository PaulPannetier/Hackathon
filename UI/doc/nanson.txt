The Borda count electoral system can be combined with an instant-runoff 
procedure to create hybrid election methods that are called Nanson method 
and Baldwin method (also called Total Vote Runoff or TVR). 
Both methods are designed to satisfy the Condorcet criterion, and allow for 
incomplete ballots and equal rankings.

The Nanson method is based on the original work of the mathematician Edward J. 
Nanson in 1882.

Nanson's method eliminates those choices from a Borda count tally that are at 
or below the average Borda count score, then the ballots are retallied as if 
the remaining candidates were exclusively on the ballot. This process is 
repeated if necessary until a single winner remains.
