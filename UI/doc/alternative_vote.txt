Alternative Voting (AV) is a type of ranked preferential voting method. 

Voters in AV elections rank the candidates in order of preference. 

Ballots are initially counted to establish the number of votes for 
each candidate. If a candidate has more than half of the first-choice 
votes, that candidate wins. If not, then the candidate with the fewest 
votes is eliminated, and the voters who selected that candidate as 
their first choice have their votes added to the total of the candidate who 
was their next choice. 

That process continues until one candidate has more than half of the votes, 
and that person is declared the winner.
