Copeland's method is one of several Condorcet methods. 
Copeland's method is a ranked voting method based on a scoring system 
of pairwise "wins", "losses", and "ties".

Each voter is asked to rank candidates in order of preference. 
A candidate A is said to have majority preference over another candidate B 
if more voters prefer A to B than prefer B to A; if the numbers are equal 
then there is a preference tie. The Copeland score for a candidate is the
number of other candidates over whom they have a majority preference plus 
half the number of candidates with whom they have a preference tie. 

The winner of the election under Copeland's method is the candidate with 
the highest Copeland score.
