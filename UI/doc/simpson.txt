In voting systems, Simpson's method is one of several Condorcet methods 
used for tabulating votes and determining a winner when using ranked 
voting in a single-winner election. 

Simpson's method selects the candidate for whom the greatest pairwise 
score for another candidate against him or her is the least such 
score among all candidates.
