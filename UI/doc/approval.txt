Approval voting is an electoral system in which voters can 
select several candidates instead of selecting only one candidate.

Approval voting ballots show a list of the options of candidates running. 
Approval voting lets each voter indicate support for a number of candidates
fixed by the approval's threshold.

Final tallies show how many votes each candidate received, and the winner 
is the candidate with the most support.
