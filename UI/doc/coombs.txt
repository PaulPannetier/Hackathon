Coombs' method or the Coombs rule is a ranked voting system which uses a ballot 
counting method for ranked voting created by Clyde Coombs. 

The Coombs' method is the application of Coombs rule to single-winner elections, 
similarly to instant-runoff voting, it uses candidate elimination and 
redistribution of votes cast for that candidate until one candidate has a 
majority of votes.

Each voter rank-orders all of the candidates on their ballot. The candidate
ranked last (again among non-eliminated candidates) by the largest number of 
voters is eliminated.
