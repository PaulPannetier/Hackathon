The Borda count is a ranked voting system : the voter ranks the 
list of candidates in order of preference.

The Borda count is a family of positional voting rules which gives 
each candidate, for each ballot, a number of points corresponding 
to the number of candidates ranked lower. In the original variant, 
the lowest-ranked candidate gets 0 points, the next-lowest gets 
1 point, etc., and the highest-ranked candidate gets n âˆ’ 1 points, 
where n is the number of candidates. 

Once all votes have been counted, the option or candidate with the 
most points is the winner.
